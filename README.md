# Linux Development Environment Configuration
This project was inspired by Jeff Geerling (geerlingguy) and his Ansible configuration for a development environment on macOS. Since I primarily use WSL, and ocassionaly full Linux machines, I have created a similar project tailored to my use cases.

## Steps to Use
1. Install OS
2. Configure user, import dotfiles
3. Ensure Python 3 and pip are installed
4. ```pip3 install ansible```
5. Restart shell (load ansible commands)
6. Run playbook for relevant distro
